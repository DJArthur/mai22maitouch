# mai22maitouch
Convert mai2touch serial data to 'old cab' maimai game(e.g. maimai FiNALE) touch, auto pass start check.  
Support ADX Serial Mode, HDX, [mai_pico](https://github.com/whowechina/mai_pico), [Mai2Touch](https://github.com/Sucareto/Mai2Touch/blob/main/Mai2Touch) and other controller with native serial touch.  
# Attention, all of these codes are basically generated by AI(DeepSeek&GPT-4o)
I really don't know if there's better way, I'm not good at programming, this is only for my own need. 
**Thanks to [@clansty](https://github.com/clansty), now we have correct Individual bit breakdown for mai2, already updated. AI is really not good at orders/tables/numbers, they will make everything messed up:(**  
# How to Use
You only need mai22maitouch.py, other files is for testing.  
1.Use [com0com](https://github.com/vovsoft/com0com) to generate pair COM33<->COM3.
3 serial ports for mai22maitouch, COM13 for your device(edit in Device Manager), COM33(virtual) for python to write in data, COM3(virtual) for game to read.
2.Edit GrooveMaster.ini (config for maimai_dump_.exe), make sure DEV 1 and NO_SERIAL 0. I don't know much about how micetools work, you can try by yourself if you use micetools.  
3.Run mai22maitouch.pyï¼Œit will start listening COM3 and COM13 (connect and config your controller's port first!).  
4.Start your game, the TouchSensor check will be a GOOD=).  
You may put a # before all the "print()" to disable printing log to console, which may optimize speed and latency.
# It works!
Tested with SDEY1.99B, cool.

I think that's enough.
