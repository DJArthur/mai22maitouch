# mai22maitouch
Convert mai2touch serial data to 'old cab' maimai game(e.g. maimai FiNALE) touch, auto pass start check.  
Support ADX Serial Mode, HDX, [mai_pico](https://github.com/whowechina/mai_pico), [Mai2Touch](https://github.com/Sucareto/Mai2Touch/blob/main/Mai2Touch) and other controller with native serial touch.  
# Attention, all of these codes are basically generated by AI(DeepSeek&GPT-4o)
I really don't know if there's better way, I'm not good at programming, this is only for my own need. 
**Thanks to [@clansty](https://github.com/clansty), now we have correct Individual bit breakdown for mai2, already updated. AI is really not good at orders/tables/numbers, they will make everything messed up:(**  
# How to Use
You only need mai22maitouch.py, pther files is for testing.  
1.Use com0com to generate 2 pairs, COM3 <-> COM23, COM13 <-> COM33.  
COM3 is the touch sensor's serial port for SDEY, COM13 for your controller (you can change it if need), COM23 COM33 for python to use (whatever you like)  
2.Edit GrooveMaster.ini, make sure DEV 1 and NO_SERIAL 0.  
3.Run mai22maitouch.pyï¼Œit will start listening COM3 and COM13.  
4.Start your game, the TouchSensor check will be a GOOD=).  
You may put a # before all the "print()" to disable printing to console, which may optimize speed and latency.
# It works!
Tested with SDEY1.99B, cool.

I think that's enough.
